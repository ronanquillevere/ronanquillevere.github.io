Hi everyone,

I tried to implement Thomas Broyer's idea to solve the nesting activities problem: [http://blog.ltgt.net/gwt-21-activities-nesting-yagni/](http://blog.ltgt.net/gwt-21-activities-nesting-yagni/)

So I created a Github project, have a look and do not hesitate to comment : [https://github.com/ronanquillevere/GWT-Multi-Activities](https://github.com/ronanquillevere/GWT-Multi-Activities)

Hope it will help some of you.

I will try to have a look to [slotted](https://code.google.com/p/slotted/) ASAP which is a framework that does exactly the opposite !
